This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Change `.env copy` to a `.env` file that will store the database where you would like it. 

as is, it will store in the `/prisa` dir in a `dev.db`

very minimal Todo list with page revalidation on change of the list of Todos. 

Main Goal: learn Next.js with an understanding difference between Server and Client
